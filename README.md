# hue_circadian_lighting
 
This is the first attempt and iteration of a custom component written specifically to interface with the Circadian Lighting custom component (https://github.com/claytonjn/hass-circadian_lighting). You must have hass-circadian_lighting installed and working, and you must have your Hue Bridges added to Home Assistant.

Add the following to your configuration.yaml

```
circadian_lighting_bridge:
```
